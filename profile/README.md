## 🌸 About Us
We are a team of Software Engineering students from **Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS)**. "Bakify" is our dedicated development group formed to tackle real-world problems faced by small, home-based food and beverage businesses through digital transformation.

## 🍰 What We Are Doing
Our flagship project is the **Bakery Inventory and Ordering System (BIOS)**.

Currently, many small bakeries rely on manual methods like social media DMs and paper notes to manage their businesses, leading to errors and inefficiency. **BIOS** is a cross-platform mobile solution designed to streamline these operations.

**Key Features:**
* 📱 **Mobile First:** A Flutter-based app for Customers and Staff.
* 📦 **Inventory Management:** Real-time tracking of stock and product listings.
* 🤖 **AI Assistance:** Integrated Google Gemini for smart product recommendations.
* 💳 **Seamless Transactions:** Integrated payment processing and order tracking.
